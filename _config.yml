title: [Latent Heuristics]
description: [In this research, we aim to investigate learning-based models trained on problem-specific datasets to facilitate creative inquiries by providing design suggestions. By doing so, we aim to address the gap between task-oriented generic solutions provided by current CAD systems and the reciprocal and problem-specific nature of the act of designing. ]
