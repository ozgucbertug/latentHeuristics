# Latent Heuristics
A short description of your project goes here. You should also refer people to your [site](https://ozgucbertug.github.io/latentHeuristics/). The files for your site are contained in the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/ozgucbertug/latentHeuristics/tree/gh-pages) branch.

I also encourage you to store your source code and data in the same repository (you can create a `src` or `data` folder).
