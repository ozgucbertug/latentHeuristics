# EDSGN-561-template
A short description of your project goes here. You should also refer people to your [site](https://cmccomb.github.io/EDSGN-561-template/). The files for your site are contained in the [`docs`](https://github.com/cmccomb/EDSGN-561-template/tree/main/docs) folder above.

I also encourage you to store your source code and data in the same repository (you can create a `src` or `data` folder).
